      <p>Movies are an amazing way to pass the time, entertain yourself, or connect with other's cultures.
        However, in this era, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find movies you enjoy since they are
        spread out into different subscription services. It is often difficult to choose which service to go to,
        and very expensive to choose all of them, so this website is geared towards helping you find
        the subscription service with the most movies that fit your taste.
